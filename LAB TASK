class Library {
  constructor() {
    this.sections = [];
    this.books = [];
    this.manager = '';
    this.openingTime = '';
    this.closingTime = '';
  }

  manageLibrary = () => {
    // code to manage the library goes here
  }

  issueBooks = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // code to issue books goes here
      resolve(this.books);
    });
  }

  addNewSection = () => {
    // code to add a new section goes here
  }

  openLibrary = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(this.openingTime);
      }, 2000);
    });
  }

  async openLibrary() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(this.openingTime);
      }, 2000);
    });
  }

  closeLibrary = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(this.closingTime);
      }, 1000);
    });
  }

  async closeLibrary() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  }
}

To create instances of the Library class and call the functions, you can do the following:


const library1 = new Library();
const library2 = new Library();

library1.issueBooks().then(books => {
  console.log(books);
});

library2.openLibrary().then(openingTime => {
  console.log(openingTime);
});

library1.closeLibrary().then(closingTime => {
  console.log(closingTime);
});

To use the async/await keywords pair to get the results of the openLibrary and closeLibrary functions, you can do the following:


const library1 = new Library();
const library2 = new Library();

async function test() {
  const openingTime = await library1.openLibrary();
  console.log(openingTime);
  const closingTime = await library2.closeLibrary();
  console.log(closingTime);
}

test();

To loop through the keys of each instance using a for-in loop and log the keys, you can do the following:


const library1 = new Library();
const library2 = new Library();

for (const key in library1) {
  console.log(key);
}

for (const key in library2) {
  console.log(key);
}

For the second part of your question, here is an example of how you can create a student registration form using React:


import React from 'react';

class StudentRegistrationForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
